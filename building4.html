    <P>
      On behalf of our faculty members, research and administrative staff,
      graduate and undergraduate students, I would like to welcome you to the
      Department of Chemistry at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals
      (KFUPM). I am delighted that you are taking some of your time to explore
      about the experience and opportunities of the academic programs we offer
      to our students. The Department of Chemistry is one of the first
      departments established at KFUPM back in 1965. Since then our academic
      platform, research facilities and human resources are constantly growing.
      Currently the department has more than 30 faculty members, 10 fulltime
      technicians, 60 graduate students and 40 undergraduate students. The
      department has succeeded in attracting faculty members with distinguished
      teaching and research qualifications. The department's facilities are
      equipped with the latest and most advanced instrumentation needed for
      research and teaching. All of that enabled us to be committed to
      excellence in education, research in all areas of chemistry, and in
      services to the community. We have been working diligently over years to
      improve the undergraduate curricula which span various areas of chemistry.
      Currently, we offer Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degrees in either
      Chemistry or Industrial Chemistry. Our freshman courses are taken by all
      science and engineering students, and our faculty work hard to maintain
      the highest standards at that crucial introductory level. Likewise, our
      higher-level undergraduate courses are comparable to those offered in
      reputable international universities. In 2015, our undergraduate program
      has been accredited by the national accrediting body; the National
      Commission for Assessment and Academic Accreditation (NCAAA). In addition,
      we run programs leading to M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry, and
      students with diverse cultural and educational backgrounds join the
      graduate program every year. Our students are very active in conducting
      research and have been recognized in several regional and international
      events. We keep a friendly environment within the department and a close
      faculty-to-student interaction, which attracts students to join our
      program. Thanks to the determination and persistence of all members at the
      Department of Chemistry. The dedication of our people and the department
      support to research make the department one of the leading departments in
      research at KFUPM and in the region. <br />
      <br />​​Dr. Abdulaziz Al-Saadi <br />
